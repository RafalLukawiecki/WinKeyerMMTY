# WinKeyer FSK for MMTTY

This is a source code repository of WinKeyerMMTY FSK extension. It supports
[WinKeyer](https://www.k1elsystems.com) devices containing WinKeyer [firmware
revision 3.1](https://www.k1elsystems.com/WinKeyer_31.html) or later. Those
devices are capable of keying RTTY FSK signal.

This extension also works with [DXLog](http://dxlog.net), a contest logger. You
can use different decoders with DXLog: MMTTY, MMVARI, 2Tone, GRITTY. However, with
this extension and a WinKeyer, you can dedicate MMTTY to do all the FSK sending.

## Why?

If your transceiver supports FSK you may want to use it instead of generating
audio-based AFSK and then modulating it using LSB. Why? Many reasons: to use your
transceiver's special FSK filters, to avoid having to configure any Tx audio
levels anywhere, not to have to think about frequency offsets (mark is mark), or
just to have fun and see how good is your radio's FSK.

Ready? You need a way to key the radio's FSK input, i.e., to convert text into a
perfectly-timed, jitter-free sequence of RTTY ITA2/Baudot mark and space
symbols. There are a few hardware interfaces around, one of which is WinKeyer
3.1. You still need to interface it with MMTTY. This extension does exactly
that. It is **only for Tx,** not for reception. To receive, you still rely on the
demodulator in MMTTY or other programs, or in your radio.

You will also need a cable that connects your WinKeyer to your radio. Instructions
are available from the [K1EL](https://www.k1elsystems.com) page specific to your
WinKeyere model. Your cable will use three wires: ground and two signals: FSK
which keys the RTTY shift from Mark (off) to Space (on), and PTT which keys the
transmitter on and off. You will probably find that your radio expects the
Mark/Space to be the other way round. Also, depending how you make your cable, you
may need to swap the K1EL suggested assignment of PTT on the WinKeyer's Key1
output, and FSK on the PTT output. To accomplish all of that, try different
combinations of the first two checkbox options shown in the extension's config
window.

## How to Use

1. Copy
[WinKeyer.fsk](https://github.com/RafalLukawiecki/WinKeyerMMTY/releases/latest/download/WinKeyer.fsk)
file to the directory containing your installation of MMTTY.
1. Select `WinKeyer` from the `PTT & FSK` section of the MMTTY `Tx` configuration
tab.
1. When the extension starts, it will show a small config and status
window. Select the COM port on which your WinKeyer is running.

It is advisable to **disable** diddles in MMTTY (set `Options/TX/DIDDLE` to
`NONE`) but **enable** them in the WinKeyer FSK window. This will improve the
pacing/timing of the diddles because they will generated by WinKeyer and not
depend on the state of the buffer or the timing of the PC.

Please note, the baud rate is taken from the MMTTY configuration settings. USOS
(Unshift on Space) can be enabled either in MMTTY or in WinKeyer. It is not yet
clear which is betterâ€”probably best to leave it on in MMTTY.

The remaining settings need to be configured in the WinKeyerFSK window, as they
are not read from MMTTY.

## Limitations and Known Issues

1. WinKeyer does not support all MMTTY options. Only 5-bit length is supported (6,
7, 8 are not). Only 1.5-bit and 2-bit stop lengths are supported (not 1). Only
45.45, 50, 75, and 100 baud speeds are supported. Hopefully this does not matter,
as 45.45 baud, 5-bit length and 1.5 stop bits is the most popular, widely used
RTTY configuration.
1. WinKeyer does not accept explicitly sent CR, LF, FIGS, or LTRS codes. It
automatically sends FIGS and LTRS as needed, including when diddling. When MMTTY
or DXLog send a CR or LF, this extension translates that to WinKeyer's }
character, which it then sends as a sequence of CR CR LF LTRS. There is some logic
in the extension to take care of different scenarios in terms of the order in
which CR or LF arrive from MMTTY or from DXLog. It should not affect operation,
but it means that printing RTTY art is not possible, because there is no way to
issue a CR without an LF.
1. There is no way to send the BELL character at present.
1. The characters being sent are being echoed back to the MMTTY window a little
sooner than when actually sent. This is most noticeable with CR/LF which is echoed
back almost immediately, even though it takes 4 characters to be sent. I will try
to solve this issue, but it is a little non-trivial because of the way MMTTY
predicts how long a character takes to send regardless of what happens in the real
world. See [issue #2](https://github.com/RafalLukawiecki/WinKeyerMMTY/issues/2).

If there are any known and unresolved issues they will be listed in the [Issues
section](https://github.com/RafalLukawiecki/WinKeyerMMTY/issues).  Please report
them there. Additional discussions are welcome on [MMTTY
Groups.io](https://groups.io/g/MMTTY-SB-RTTY/topics).

## How to Build

Borland C++ Builder version 5.0 is needed to build this project. It is ancient,
but it still works well if you can find it.

After a successful build, you will find `WinKeyerMMTY.dll`. Rename it to
`WinKeyer.fsk`.

## History

This project is based on the tinyFSK project by Nobuyuki Oba JA7UDE, who, in turn,
based his work on the EXTFSK64 project.  There is still much unnecessary code, and
the overall code structure is much too complicated.  Apologies from all
contributors for a rather dirty source code.

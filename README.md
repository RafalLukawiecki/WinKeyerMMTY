TinyFsk for MMTTY

This is a source code repository of tinyFSK.FSK.

Borland C++ Builder version 5.0 is needed to build this project.

After a successful build, you will have extfsk.dll. Rename it to tinyFSK.FSK.

Note: I made this project based on EXTFSK64. There still remain some codes that are unnecessary for the tinyfsk module. Sorry for dirty codes.

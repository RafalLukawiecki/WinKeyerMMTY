# WinKeyer FSK for MMTTY

This is a source code repository of WinKeyerMMTY FSK extension. It supports
[WinKeyer](https://www.k1elsystems.com) devices containing WinKeyer [firmware
revision 3.1](https://www.k1elsystems.com/WinKeyer_31.html) or later. Those
devices are capable of keying RTTY FSK signal.

## How to Use

1. Copy **WinKeyer.fsk** file to the directory containing your installation of
MMTTY.
1. Select `WinKeyer` from the `PTT & FSK` section of the MMTTY `Tx` configuration
tab.
1. When the extension starts, it will show a small config and status
window. Select the COM port on which your WinKeyer is running.

Please note, the baud rate and the number of stop bits are taken from the MMTTY
configuration settings.  Optionally, configure its additional settings using that
window.

## How to Build

Borland C++ Builder version 5.0 is needed to build this project.

After a successful build, you will find `WinKeyerMMTY.dll`. Rename it to
`WinKeyer.fsk`.

## History

This project is based on the tinyFSK project by Nobuyuki Oba JA7UDE, who, in turn,
based his work on the EXTFSK64 project.  There is still much unnecessary code, and
the overall code structure is much too complicated.  Apologies from all
contributors for a rather dirty source code.
